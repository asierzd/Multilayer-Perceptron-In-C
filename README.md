# Multilayer-Perceptron-In-C
This is my solution to a final practice that consisted in developing a multilayer perceptron from the Programming Fundamentals subject. 

## Compilation and execution

If you want to try to execute it, you need the configuration file of the perceptron 'configuracion', the input file 'entrada' and the main program 'main.c'. You need to execute in the same directory as all these files the following command `gcc "main.c" -o main -lm`, and then to run it just `./main`
